                <h3>Purpose</h3> </header>
            <section>
                <p>The purpose of Mov Reviews is provide people with simple and quick access to movie ratings by their fellow human beings. By doing this, people can know which movies they will most likely enjoy and which ones they can wait for to come out on DVD or be rentable. One of the key parts of Mov Reviews will also be having a Parent Guide section so that people can know if there are any scenes in the movie they don't deem appropriate for themselves, family, or friends. </p>
