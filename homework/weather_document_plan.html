 <h3>Task 1 - Purpose Statement</h3>
<p>This webpage is an assignment for my CIT 230 Web Front-end Development. The purpose of this page is to provide weather information for<br>a person living in Greenville, Springfield, or Franklin. It is built with the mission to provide a great UX and follow web designing principles. </p>
<h3> Task 2 - Audience</h3>
<p>This webpage will be compatible with a desktop/laptop, tablet, and iPhone. The main purpose for the audience will be acquiring the weather forecast they need quickly and easily.<br> The target audience could could range from the ages of someone in their teens to someone elderly. This will be popular information for those who are interested in knowing what <br> the weather will be like for their day and throughout the week.It will be adapted for people located in the cities of Greenville, Springfield, or Franklin. This is targeted towards people <br> who have enough income(or their families do) to own either a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a smart phone device. </p>
<h3> Task 3 - Persona</h3>
<p>Clark Kent is someone who commutes into work everday via various methods of transportation, therefore, knowing what the weather will be like is very important to him.<br> Clark works in the center of the city as a writer for the Daily Planet. He likes to be prepared and ready for things in his life, so knowing what clothes to wear or whether <br> or not to take an umbrella into work, or outside for lunch, makes his life a lot easier. He's someone who frequently travels outside the city for work, so he uses his <br> smart device to check weather in certain areas.  Clark loves to help people, hopes to become a great writer, and someday have a family.<br><br>Quote: "Should I take my umbrella into work today?"</p>

<h3> Task 4 - WireFrames </h3>
<p>p.s. the photos are flipped apparently due to an issue with the iPhone5 models, at least that's what I read online (I will fix this as soon as I figure out how to!)</p>

<h3> Task 5 - Peer Review</h3>
<p> Eric Keller was my peer reviewer. Eric gave me some great ideas on what to add or change and I like that he also let me know what he liked and why. I was advised to put a search box on the desktop browser, which is something I figured not adding because of my menu button. I plan on having everything the users need in the menu, but I will definitely take this into consideration and perhaps add it in the future, depending on how advanced the web page becomes. Some of the ideas presented are the following: "I do like the spacing that you give between elements, good breathing room." "The desktop outline looks great and clean. I would however include a clear search section for the user to use." </p>
