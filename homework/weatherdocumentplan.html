 <h3>Task 1 - Purpose Statement</h3>

<h3> Task 2 - Audience</h3>
<p>This webpage will be compatible with a desktop/laptop, tablet, and iPhone. The target audience could could range from the ages of around 15 to 100.<br>This will be popular information for those who are interested in knowing what the weather will be like for their day and throughout the week.<br>It will be adapted for people located in the cities of Greenville, Springfield, or Franklin. This is targeted towards people who have enough income<br>(or their families do) to own either a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a smart phone device. </p>
<h3> Task 3 - Persona</h3>
<p>Dick Grayson is someone who commutes into work everday via various methods of transportation, therefore, knowing what the weather will be like is very important to him.<br> Mr. Grayson works at an office building in the center of the city and is an analyst. He likes to be prepared and ready for things in his life, so knowing what clothes to wear or <br> whether or not to take an umbrella into work, or outside for lunch, makes his life a lot easier. Mr. Grayson hopes to become a top analyst in the agency and someday have a family. </p>
