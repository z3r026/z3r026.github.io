                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                <p> This is a website that is inviting to all people, but could easily be seen to be focused on those who follow Christ or those who want to. A lot of people visit this site in order to learn more of Christ and the tabs up top are all areas in which one would want to search through: scriptues and study, families and individuals, share the gospel, inspiration and news, and serve and teach. I can honestly imagine people of all ages visiting this website. I can picture a newlywed couple who are expecting children looking for guidance on how to raise a family. I can also see a young adult or someone in their youth looking for answers to their life. Currently, there is a link to a live broadcast of General Conference. This is where prophets, apostles, and seventy will share messages that they feel inspired to give and messages directly from the Lord himself. They give guidance and counsel which is what a lot of people who visit this website are seeking.</p>

            <section id="Target Audience">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>I believe that this website targets ALL people. Perhaps one could say that it is specifically targeting those who are Christians. Often times there are qutoes from scriptures on the main page, such as "Learn more of Him" or "Follow Him." These are invitations to whomever may see the message. They also have a clear tab up top that reads, "Families and Individuals." This really does encompass all people. Looking for specific videos, talks, manuals, or scriptures is made super user friendly as their are tabs for those things and quicklinks provided on the main page as well. The typography is great as well as it provides good visual hierarchy for the reader and contrasting texts also improve readibility. The bar that contains the search box and drop down menu contrasts super well with the white background. It is super easy to find what you're looking for and it has the same feel as the webpage. Another thing I loved is that the header of the site never changed depending on where you went on the site, it was constant. You are given a log in button at the top right, a search bar that goes from left to right, and a drop down menu for quick options. This repitition and following of convention helps the user know where to go. The alignment was great as well as the proximity. There is plenty of white space which prevents it from giving a cluttered feeling. 10/10!</p>

                <h2> Site Contrast</h2>
                <h1>BYU-I</h1>
                <p>1. This website does know who it's Target Audience is, but could be improved. For someone who wants to know about BYU-I and is not LDS, I think it could be better if there was an, "About" tab or link right on the front page.</p>
                <p>2. I suppose they meet the needs, but it seems difficult to find things. For example, one can scroll forever and their are a ton of quicklinks, but it seems there was no focus on proximity; it doesn't seem like each thing has its place</p>
                <p>3. As mentioned above, it is quite difficult to find certain material. There is a search bar, but a lot of times people who are browsing on their mobile are trying to find something quickly.</p>
                <p>4. It did on the Home Page, but after logging in, it is quite difficult to navigate. For example, you have to zoom in on areas and when you get into BrightSpace to do homework, it becomes extremely difficult.</p>
